*Python library for diversity analysis for immune repertoire*


Sequencing immunoglobulin using high-throughput sequencing platform (Ig-Seq)
enables to snapshot the adaptive immune repertoires,
giving us the insights to better understanding immune responses in health and disease.
Large amounts of raw data produced by Ig-Seq require effective ways for anlaysis.
PyDAIR is a tool for diversity analysis of Ig-Seq data.
The main functions of PyDAIR are the  identification of VDJ genes and determination of CDR3 regions.
