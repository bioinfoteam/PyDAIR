PyDAIR
======

PyDAIR is a Python package that aims to study immunoglobulin heavy (IgH)
chain diversity based on repertoire-sequencing (Rep-Seq) data.
PyDAIR identifies the germline variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) genes
that used by each IgH sequence.
BLAST is used for aligning sequences to a database of known germline VDJ genes to assign VDJ.
PyDAIR supports all features as long as the two motifs, YYC and WGxG,
that located at the end of V gene and the start of J gene are know.
PyDAIR is available under the terms of the GNU license.
