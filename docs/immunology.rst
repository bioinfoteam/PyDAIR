Repertoire diversity
====================

The diversity of immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire is derived from
VDJ rearrangement\ [#Tonegawa1983]_.
It is estimated that  more than 10\ :sup:`13` different B cell
receptors in human\ [#Georgiou2014]_.




Immunoglobulin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A unit of Ig is comprised of two heavy chains (IgH) and two light chains (IgL),
and each chain is comprised of a variable region and a constant region.
The variable region of IgH is comprised of single of V, D, and J genes.
CDR3 is defined between YYC motif at the end of V gene and WGxG motif at the start of J gene.
CDR3 is the most variable region on IgH sequence and predominantly determines
the specificity of IgH\ [#Xu2000]_\ [#Benedict2000]_.

VDJ recombination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The variable region of IgH is generated by DNA rearrangements, also known as VDJ recombination.
During the recombination process, single of V, D, and J gene are randomly selected from sets of germline gene.
The rearrangement frequently results in nucleotide additions and deletions at the V-D and D-J junctions.
Therefore, the region around the junctions of V-D and D-J
(i.e., the complementarity-determining region 3; CDR3) is known to be the most variable region on IgH sequence.
