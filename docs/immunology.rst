Repertoire diversity
====================

The diversity of repertoire is known to be generated by DNA rearrangements of the VDJ genes\ [#Tonegawa1983]_.
It is estimated that more than 10\ :sup:`18` different T cell receptors (TCRs)\ [#Robins2010]_
and more than 10\ :sup:`13` different B cell receptors (BCRs) in human\ [#Georgiou2014]_.





Immunoglobulin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An immunoglobulin molecule consists of two light chains (IgL) and two heavy chians (IgH).
Each chain, whether IgL or IgH, consists of a constant region and a variable region.
The variable region of IgL is composed with V and J genes,
as well as the variable region of IgH is composed with V, D and J genes.

VDJ recombination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The variable region is generated by DNA rearrangements, also known as VDJ recombination.
During the recombination process, single of V, D, and J gene are randomly selected
from sets of germline gene to rearrangement of IgH sequence variable region.
The rearrangement frequently results in nucleotide additions and deletions
at the V-D and D-J junctions.
Therefore, the region around the junctions of V-D and D-J,
known as complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3),
is the most variable locus on IgH sequence and predominantly determines the specificity of IgH\ [#Xu2000]_\ [#Benedict2000]_.
